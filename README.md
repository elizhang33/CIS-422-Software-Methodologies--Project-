A very brief description of the system

This system will be used to collect users basic geospatial data, such as latitude, longitude, time, and date, and to use those data to help users to keep tracking their activity paths as well as to send out notification to users who are concerned about getting exposed to close contact with other users who are confirmed with COVID-19 virus.

When it was created The phase 1 of this system was started to be created from April 12th, 2020 and was able to technically be used on April 27th, 2020. Then, the phase 2, contact tracing, was started on May 14th, 2020, and new changes and improvements was made after this date. The full system was able to technically run on May 31st, 2020.

Why it was created such as the class name and assignment This is one of the projects from CIS 422 Software Methodologies at University of Oregon. More specific, this project was created regarding the fact that people are suggested to keep social distancing and are concerned about the risk of exposure to infections from other confirmed people. Thus, a contact tracing function would help people get notified in time once they are exposed to the risk.

What needs to be done to compile the source code and run the program The installation instruction files contain detailed information about how to install and run the system successfully.

Any additional setup that is needed No additional setup is needed for users since what the users need to do is just open the website of our system on their cell phones. Anyone wanting to deploy this system should refer to the installation instructions. A $5 cost of signing up a pythonanywhere account is expected if one party wants run a similar web like this one. A gmail account is also needed to run the email service.

Software dependencies such as the version of the compiler The app is run using Python3. The packages and versions used are specified in our requirements.txt file

A brief description of what is in each subdirectory in the directory structure.

In the Milestone Tracker, a timeline that indicates our breakdown of task and assignment, and working process management information was provided.

In the SRS, a detailed description of Software Requirements Specification was provided.

In the SDS, an easily understandable specification of the system architecture was provided.

In the Project_plan, a description of how effectively the team performs project planning, how well it followed the plan, how well the team adapts the plan to inevitable hiccups, and whether risks are effectively considered, mitigated, and re-evaluated when plan change was provided.

In the README.txt, a brief description of what is in this directory of files was provided.

In the Programmer_Documentation, a description of how the software works from the perspective of a person who could write or modify the source code for the project was provided.

In the Installation_Instructions, a description of how to install the system was provided.

In the User_Documentation, an explanation to users of how to accomplish specific tasks with the system was provided.
